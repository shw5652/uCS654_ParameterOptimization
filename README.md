# uCS654_ParameterOptimization

Task :

Choose any multi-class dataset from UCI library. Dataset size must have rows between 5k and 30k. Divide the dataset into 70-30 fro training and testing with 10 different samples. Optimize the parameters of SVM for every sample with 100 iterations and report the best parameters. Plot the convergence graph for the sample whose accuracy is maximum. Showcase the complete result on github with basic data analytics of the selected dataset.
