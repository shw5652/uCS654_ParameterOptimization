# UCS654_ParameterOptimization

# Task :

Choose any multi-class dataset from UCI library. Dataset size must have rows between 5k and 30k. Divide the dataset into 70-30 fro training and testing with 10 different samples. Optimize the parameters of SVM for every sample with 100 iterations and report the best parameters. Plot the convergence graph for the sample whose accuracy is maximum. Showcase the complete result on github with basic data analytics of the selected dataset.


# Report :

No dataset for multi-class dataset of size between 5k and 30k found. Using dataset "Predict Students' Dropout and Academic Success" of row-size 4.4k.

Dataset Information
For what purpose was the dataset created?

The dataset was created in a project that aims to contribute to the reduction of academic dropout and failure in higher education, by using machine learning techniques to identify students at risk at an early stage of their academic path, so that strategies to support them can be put into place. 

The dataset includes information known at the time of student enrollment â€“ academic path, demographics, and social-economic factors. 

The problem is formulated as a three category classification task (dropout, enrolled, and graduate) at the end of the normal duration of the course.
